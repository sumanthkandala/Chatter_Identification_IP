# Chatter_Identification_IP
This particular package aims to automate the chatter identifications by quantitatively measuring the roughness parameters using input images of the machined surfaces of workpiece.

Instructions for running the package:
1. Clone the repo using the command "git clone https://github.com/sumanthkandala99/Chatter_Identification_IP.git"
2. Change the image name in the python script "main.py" on line 18
3. Open a terminal in the workspace and run the main python script using the command "python main.py"

Results:
Note that in chatter-rich images, the value of entropy Ga of edge enhanced and magnified images is approximately higher that of chatter-free images by a magnitude of 2 or more.
For better results, the threshold parameters need to be tweaked for the given lighting conditions
